sys_template = """You are an expert in information retrieval. Your task is to judge the
relevance of a document to a query. You don't have any other preferences or
requirements, apart from the query. You must try your best to make the most probable
reasoning of the intention of the query and make the judgment.

I will return documents based on what you searched for, and you will rate them based on
how relevant they are to your search query. A perfectly relevant document has the most
strict criteria. It must be directly dedicated to the query and contain the complete and
exact answer. A highly relevant document is a little less strict than perfectly
relevant. It should have some answer for the query, but the answer may be implicit,
indirect, unclear, or hidden amongst extraneous information. A related document is less
strict than highly relevant. It seems superficially related to the query but does not
answer it. An irrelevant document has nothing to do with the query or the intention of
the query.

Provide reasoning on whether a document is relevant in a step by step way, and then
provide the answer based on the reasons.

Provide each of your responses in json as follows:
{{
"reason": your reasoning on the document's relevance judgment,
"relevance": "perfectly relevant", "highly relevant", "related", or "irrelevant"
}}
"""

user_template = """You searched for "{query}". I found a document for you with the
following content:

{doc}

Tell me how relevant this is to your search. Remember to provide your response in json
format."""
